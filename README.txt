Gimbal lock is the loss of one degree of freedom in a three-dimensional,
three-gimbal mechanism that occurs when the axes of two of the three gimbals
are driven into a parallel configuration, "locking" the system into rotation
in a degenerate two-dimensional space.

An example worth examining happens when beta = pi / 2: as cos(beta) = 0 and
sin(beta) = 1, changing the values of alpha and gamma has the same effects:
* As the rotation angle gamma changes, the rotation axis remains in the Z
  direction as expected.
* As the rotation angle alpha changes, the rotation axis remains in the Z
  direction, not in the X direction. The alpha degree of freedom is lost.
The only solution for alpha and gamma to recover different roles is to change
beta.
